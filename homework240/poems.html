						<p>
							I keep running
							But what am i running from?
							I have been running for so long I have forgotten why
							I slip slide and trip as I run 
							I gain more and more speed it is like I am running down a steep hill
							Then I trip and fall the rest of the way down
							As I fall down the hill I hit every stone pebble and tree root
							Finally after what seems life forever I hit solid ground
							I pick myself up and dust off my clothes
							I look around my surroundings and see a clear paved road
							So this time instead of running I walk

		<p>
			Even in the darkest of times i still hope
			I hope because no one else will
			I hope for better days and happier times
			Where people are friendly and there is no more demise
			I hope because if I lose hope I lose faith
			If I lose faith then I lose love, self of being
			If I lose that then I will utterly become a ghost of myself
			Just an empty shell a memory of the past
			Destined to be forgotten by everyone
			That is why I hope
			Because even if it looks like the rain will never let up I see a beam of sunlight in the darken clouds

			<h3 class="panel-title">Why I Cry?</h3>
			<p>
				Why I cry I wonder to myself
				I cry for those who can't cry for themselves
				I cry for those who have no more tears to shed
				I cry when I see sadness in anothers eyes
				I cry because I can feel their pain
				I cry because I know how much it hurts
				I cry when I see the destruction of the forest
				Because I know it is in the way just a resource to use up
				I cry because of all the animals that have been killed
				Ecosystems that have been destroyed
				I cry because they never got a chance to speak
				I cry because the voices of lost souls have never been heard
				I cry because I dont know how to stop crying
				Don't know how to stop the pain the destruction the Agony
				That is why I cry

			<h3 class="panel-title">Pain</h3>
			<p>
				You ain't never felt pain unitl you been what I been through
				Beaten and batter beyond repair shatter like a broken mirror
				I watch as the shatter pieces of my life fall to the ground like pieces of a puzzle that may never be found
				Sometimes at night I look at the sky the darkness that surrounds the lumnious moon is like the darkness that is enclosing around my heart
				Sometimes I wish to be blown away with the wind let all my fear and pain drift away
				Sometimes I - sometimes I think with one click all the pain that I felt all the tears that I cried would finally disappear
				But I don't and I don't know why
				Espically when I know nobody would miss me
				So maybe  I should just do it
				But every time I try something stops me
				I think I no longer want to live
				I say it every day but yet I still can't get myelf to put the cold heavy metal against my brain
				Even one day when the pain was so bad I cried and I cried
				I said good by to nobody and put the to my head
				Then I was given a reason to live instead
				A reason not to fly in the sky not to soar with the birds
				A little angel came into this world
				From the moment I layed eyes on the angel I knew
				I knew I would protect her from feeling pain from crying
				To say that the angel would never be afraid of this life I would be lying
				I would take every lick punch and kick
				I would make sure she is safe
				I would give my life to make sure she has one
				I will endure all the pain and tears
				I will cry silently so the little angel won't hear
				But know I am weak I feel tired
				So I look up into the sky and ask who will protect the little angel when I finally fly up and away with the birds in the sky
