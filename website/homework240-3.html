                        <h3>A Lonely Ghost</h3>
						I look around and time passes before my eyes
						I watch as my family expand and grow as the years pass me by
						The young get old and the old die
						Everybody changes everybody changes but me
						I watch the never ending cycle of life 
						Watching it through the same eyes wearing the same clothes
						I don't change because I am a ghost
						Curse to spend my entire after life walking this earth
						I cannot haunt anybody because I cannot be seen or heard
						It gets very lonely here
						Sometimes I would go to 42st in Manhattan it used to be m down the many by favorite place with neon light and attractions
						As I walk down the many blocks people pass right through me
						At first it bothered me but as the years flew by me I got used to it
						Do you want to know the hardest thing to get used to?
						Being lonely it is my hell on earth
						As I walk down the blocks I peer through the store windows
						I see family and friends laughing and having a good time
						But more importantly they have each other where i have no one
						As I continue down the block crossing the street i think 
						Why did i kill myself?
						Was my time in the physical human world really worth this hell?
						Maybe i am meant to be alone
						Maybe i deserve to become this lonely ghost
