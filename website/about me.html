					<h3>The Gift of Being Me</h3>
					What makes me, me
					What sets me apart from every one else?
					What makes me special?
					What makes me different?
					Is it because i don't let what people say faze me?
					Or maybe it is because I am my own person
					Is it because I am a woman that is her own man?
					I think the gift of being me is that I love myself
					Because I know the only person I can count on in the long run is myself
					I know I am special
					I don't need anyone to tell me that I already know
					I see life through different eyes with all its opportunities and possibilites
					I don't need anybody putting me down telling what I can and can not do
					I am my own gift I represent the intelligence of life and what it has to offer
					Do you know why?
					It is because I am a woman put on this earth to lead others like me to a higher calling
					To lead women like me to a utopian society were women all around can be free to experience all that life has to offer
					Where they know longer have to suffer through the hardships of life
					That is the gift of being me
